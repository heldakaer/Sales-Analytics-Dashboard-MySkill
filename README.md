Here, I used the Superstore Dataset (9994 records) to create a sales analytics dashboard with Microsoft Excel. 
The Superstore dataset contains:
- Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
- Customer Details: Customer ID, Name, Segment, Region
- Product Details: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Name
- Transaction Details: Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount

This sales analytics and dashboard aims to answer:
- What are the total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Profit Margin?
- How are the monthly sales and profit margin trends?
- How are sales distributed across customer segments?
- Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
